 * @brief Computes the Intersection over Union (IoU) between two polygons.
 *
 * This function calculates the IoU metric by first computing the bounding rectangles
 * for the predicted and ground truth polygons, then measuring the area of their
 * intersection and union. The IoU is used to quantify the overlap between the two shapes.
 *
 * @param pred Vector of cv::Point representing the predicted polygon.
 * @param gt Vector of cv::Point representing the ground truth polygon.
 * @return A double in the range [0.0, 1.0] representing the IoU value.

 * @brief Evaluates predictions against ground truth annotations from a COCO-style JSON file.

 * to ground truth polygons using IoU and class label comparison, and computes precision,
 * recall, and F1-score metrics based on the matches.
 *
 * @param json_path Path to the COCO-format JSON file containing ground truth annotations.
 * @param predictions Map from image filename to a vector of predicted polygons and their labels.
 * @param iou_threshold Minimum IoU required to consider a prediction as correct.

 * and high cards (10–A) are -1.

 * @return cv::Scalar representing the corresponding BGR color.
