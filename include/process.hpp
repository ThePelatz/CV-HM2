/**
 * @brief Extracts corner points from contour point pairs based on external extrema.
 *
 * This function processes a list of contours (typically representing cards or blocks in an image)
 * and, using externally provided reference points, computes the corner points that define
 * rectangular regions (e.g., cells or blocks) within each contour.
 *
 * The method works by:
 * - Calculating the perpendicular distance of each contour point from the line connecting the external corners,
 * - Identifying local maxima in the distance profile to detect significant internal extremities,
 * - Pairing these extremities symmetrically to define sub-blocks,
 * - Building sets of four corner points for each detected region.
 *
 * If only one pair of extrema is found, the contour is assumed to represent a single block.
 * If multiple pairs are found, the contour is assumed to contain sub-blocks (e.g., multiple rows or cells).
 *
 * @param cards    A vector of contours (each a vector of cv::Point), representing the shapes of cards or regions.
 * @param ext_pts  A vector of external reference points for each contour. Each element must contain two points:
 *                 [0] is the bottom-left (bl) corner, [1] is the top-right (tr) corner.
 *
 * @return A vector of quadrilaterals (each a vector of 4 cv::Point elements), representing the detected regions
 *         in each contour. The order of points for each quadrilateral is:
 *         bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right, top-left.
 *
 * @note
 * - Corner points are slightly adjusted with a pixel tolerance to improve robustness.
 * - This function relies on helper functions `point_line_distance`, `find_local_maxima`, and
 *   `pair_indices_symmetric`, which must be defined elsewhere.
 * - Debug information is printed to `std::cout`, indicating the number of extrema pairs found per contour.

/**
 * @brief Detects and extracts quadrilateral regions (e.g., cards) from a binary image.
 *
 * This function performs a complete processing pipeline to detect rectangular objects (such as cards)
 * from a binary image, typically pre-processed (e.g., thresholded or edge-detected).
 * It identifies external contours, filters them based on geometric constraints, and refines them
 * by locating corner points and reordering contour data for consistent downstream processing.
 *
 * The method involves the following steps:
 * - Detect external contours in the binary image using OpenCV's `findContours`.
 * - Filter out contours that do not meet minimum area and perimeter thresholds to retain only likely card shapes.
 * - For each valid contour:
 *    - Determine the two contour points closest to the image's bottom-left and top-right corners.
 *    - Save these external points as references for further corner refinement.
 *    - Reorder the contour points such that the bottom-left corner appears first.
 * - Optionally, visualize all detected contours for debugging or inspection purposes.
 * - Extract and return a set of ordered corner points representing rectangular regions for each card.
 *
 * @param image  Input image (`cv::Mat`), typically a binary (black and white) image.
 *               Must not be empty. The image is not modified directly.
 *
 * @return A vector of quadrilateral shapes (`std::vector<std::vector<cv::Point>>`),
 *         where each inner vector contains four points ordered as:
 *         bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right, top-left.

 * - Top-left has the smallest sum (x + y).
 * - Bottom-right has the largest sum (x + y).
 * - Top-right has the largest difference (x - y).
